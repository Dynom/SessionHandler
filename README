Introduction

This session handler has one purpose: To provide a high-available back-end
for sessions. Easily implementable for existing and new systems.


Installation

Make sure you meet the requirements for the drivers you which to use.
If you plan to only use one driver, don't use this system as it will
have overhead with no additional benefits.

Set the config directive 'save_handler' to 'user'. Do this either in
your php.ini, webserver option directive (such as .htaccess) or in 
your script (Like so: ini_set('session.save_handler', 'user');)


Drivers

At moment of writing there are two, the Memcache and the MySQL

* Memcache
  Make sure you have the 'Memcache' extension (note that there are multiple
  Memcache extension.)
  
* MySQL
  Make sure you compiled PHP with MySQL support

* .. 
  Write your own driver, commit it and supply the documentation ;-)
